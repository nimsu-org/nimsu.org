Hello, students of La Trobe University's Bundoora campus. We're NIMSU, a team of students who have decided to volunteer their time to investigate and report on issues surrounding the student union/association in Deakin Burwood and La Trobe Bundoora. 

You may be asking why we are looking into student unions and associations specifically, and if we are anti-union. 

We are not anti-union. We are pro-union for real! Elected union representatives who do not act in good faith or vote against the public student interest will hurt everyone, so it's important that the people we elect into our student unions are strong, and have a genuine left-leaning approach to unionism. NIMSU as a whole is not affiliated with any political group, and we will not recruit students into The NIMSU Team if they are actively working in "stupol" or are determined to have a conflict of interest. If you are actively working in a student union/association and you witness a student representative doing something wrong, [you can tell us via ProtonMail or Signal](https://nimsu.org/contact/).

If you aren't part of a union or a student union yet, do not let our journalism dissuade you. **Student unions are a vital component of student life**, and we owe a lot of the things we enjoy today to our student union. Specifically at La Trobe, the La Trobe Student Union has helped bring back the Glider bus, end lock-out fees in the dormitories during daytime, and provide a food bank in Bundoora. So please, let our work **empower** you to participate in a healthy and active union, otherwise the amenities we rely on can be taken away from us. 

Love,
The NIMSU Team.
