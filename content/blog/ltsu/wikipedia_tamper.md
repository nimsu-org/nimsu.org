We've discovered during our investigation that a majority of the recent edits made to the La Trobe Student Union's Wikipedia article were done by the user "Master of No Nuns". This user is believed to be Vitoria-Iris Cooke, the only remaining Queer Officer for 2023 in the La Trobe Student Union. An edit made by the account during the early hours of the 5th of September reverts a previous edit made by another user which restored an infobox disclosing multiple issues with the article, including the use of original research and references to self-published material (citing directly from the La Trobe Student Union's own website).

> As will the University of Sydney it is important to know who the representatives of the students are. This can be seen in the changes I have made as a representative of the Union.  
  -- *["Master of No Nuns"](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=La_Trobe_Student_Union&oldid=1173924052), believed to be Vitoria-Iris Cooke.*

This is only one of multiple edits where "Master of No Nuns" engaged in an edit war where they had repeatedly removed the infobox disclosing issues with the Wikipedia article. 

As a result, the account was [blocked for 24 hours on September 6](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Master_Of_No_Nuns&oldid=1176072709) for violating the three-revert rule and edit warring. 

Vitoria-Iris Cooke is a candidate on the Change ticket for the La Trobe Student Election, running for Vice President alongside Yeshuah Allen Veloso (Education and Welfare respectively).

Love,  
The NIMSU Team.
