NIMSU Ferret can report that the Rabelais has not had a new issue of the magazine released since Issue #1 (released at the start of Semester 1 2023, though their websites states that post-COVID they have switched to predominately digital publication), and has not added any new articles to their website since early May. 

For the entirety of 2023, only three articles have been published to the website: 

- [Rio Tinto on Campus and why YOU should care](https://www.rabelais.com.au/la-trobe/57915sts2got3cr56hntu6f8sthb5v), an article contending for the removal of Rio Tinto from La Trobe Bundoora. 
- [In Your Face](https://www.rabelais.com.au/la-trobe/in-your-face), an article about the importance of student unionism amidst the rise in anti-LGBTQIA+ hate rhetoric by neo-Nazi groups in Naarm ("Melbourne"). 
- Finally, [La Trobe University staff to strike over proposed staffing cuts: A Discussion on the Concerns in Australian Higher Education](https://www.rabelais.com.au/la-trobe/0u0ces5v9y5ib0t0za6tdyvwqjuuei), bringing attention to NTEU's concerns at the time about proposed changes to staffing by La Trobe University and a reminder that a strike will be occurring on the third of May. 

While Ferret believes the quality of these articles are definitely satisfactory and are relevant to issues students face on campus, three articles in the entirety of 2023 released within the first semester is despicable, especially in comparison to last year where Rabelais published three times as many articles, and that's excluding the articles published for the writing competition that year. 

The La Trobe Student Union is allowing an important resource to waste away. Which means students are being left in the dark about what the "peak representative body" for La Trobe Bundoora students is doing, especially amidst tensions regarding the newly added Section 12 to the Election Regulations and a disturbing lack of transparency around policy making in the student union.
