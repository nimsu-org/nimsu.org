Not in My Student Union (NIMSU) is an anonymously ran team of student journalists who cover student union and association issues across University campuses in Melbourne. 

We're volunteers, and put the public student interest at the centre of our articles.

Our constitution and current policies are publicly available to read, however current ongoing investigations aren't available until they are finished. 

We do not keep records of whistleblower or journalist identities, and The NIMSU Team will not respond to requests of these kind under any circumstances.
