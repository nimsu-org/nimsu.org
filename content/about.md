Not in My Student Union (NIMSU) is an anonymously ran team of student journalists who cover student union and association issues across University campuses in Melbourne. The name "NIMSU" is a satirical take on [Not In My Backyard (NIMBY)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIMBY). The NIMSU Team is spread across Deakin University's Burwood campus and La Trobe University's Bundoora campus.

We're volunteers, and put the public student interest at the centre of our articles. 

# Transparency
While we are anonymous, NIMSU has some public processes in place to help people who come to NIMSU understand how we will handle their information. You can read those here:

- [The NIMSU Process](/whistleblowing-policy/)
- [Commitment to Fair Reporting](/impartiality/)

We do not keep records of whistleblower or journalist identities, and The NIMSU Team will not respond to requests of this kind under any circumstances.
