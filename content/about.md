Not in My Student Union (NIMSU) is an anonymously ran team of student journalists who cover student union and association issues across University campuses in Melbourne. The name "NIMSU" is a satirical take on [Not In My Backyard (NIMBY)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIMBY).

We're volunteers, and put the public student interest at the centre of our articles. 

# Transparency
Our constitution and current policies are publicly available to read (will be uploaded soon), however current ongoing investigations aren't typically available until they are finished. 

We do not keep records of whistleblower or journalist identities, and The NIMSU Team will not respond to requests of this kind under any circumstances.

# Postering Campaigns
We usually outsource postering for NIMSU to people over tasking services. People who are postering for NIMSU do not know the identities of The NIMSU Team and likely don't know what NIMSU is until they are given the posters and locations to post said posters. 

Because of this, The NIMSU Team asks that you kindly do not accost posterers for NIMSU. They will not be able to provide you any useful information whatsoever.
