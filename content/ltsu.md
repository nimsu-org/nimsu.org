NIMSU is currently keeping track of club stacking at La Trobe University's Bundoora campus. As of November 2023, 
multiple students have been interviewed about student representatives allegedly approaching them about creating 
to secure endorsements. 

If you or someone you know has been approached about creating a club with the promise of something in exchange for
a club endorsement, we encourage you to come forward and [contact us (MailHide Link)](https://mailhide.io/e/UcFdgVOy).
