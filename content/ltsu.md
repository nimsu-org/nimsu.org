We’ve been looking into your student representatives from the La Trobe Student Union, and we’ve discovered that some of them 
might be hiding quite a few skeletons in their closets. 

## Are you a student representative? Look out for us. 
Some NIMSU mules will be hanging around the La Trobe Bundoora campus near the end of September. 
They will be on the look out for you so that they can hand you an envelope containing a personalised Eagle File. 
These documents will detail questions, an offer for an interview and, if applicable, allegations for you to 
respond to. It is important that you accept your Eagle File. 
### What happens if I refuse to take my Eagle File?
Refusing to take your Eagle File means refusing to comment on what's contained in it. 
The NIMSU mule will be noting down who takes their file and who doesn't, and this will be
mentioned in our report.

## When will our investigation release?
We will release our investigation hopefully by early October 2023. 
Student representatives will get our investigation first so that they can reply to our findings.
