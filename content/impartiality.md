title: Commitment to Fair Reporting

In order to ensure our investigations are as truthful and fair as possible, any information you provide to NIMSU will undergo fact-checking processes over time. This process involves:

- Cross-examining your information with other sources and evidence on hand.
- Undergoing Line-By-Line verification, where we may re-engage with sources and potentially challenge their information, giving the right to reply.
- While NIMSU itself as a left-leaning team that's pro-union, we maintain impartiality throughout all processes to ensure our reporting is as truthful and fair as possible.
    - This does mean, in most cases, the accused will be given a right to reply to all allegations before we publish our reports, however we will confirm with all sources about what they are comfortable having on the record, and redact information as per request.
- Sending excerpts of our reports to sources so that they understand the context they are being represented in on larger investigations.

If you have feedback or suggestions on how we can improve our processes, you can contact us via the nimsu-tips ProtonMail.
