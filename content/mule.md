## Information for Mules, La Trobe Bundoora in September
There's a good chance that recipients of an Eagle File will make a significant effort to avoid NIMSU Mules, so please follow these guidelines.
- Wear plain clothing preferably with a shirt pocket (hoodies are permitted), you don't want to draw too much attention. 
- Blend into the foot traffic around the Agora. 
- Have a camera (phone or body cam) always recording either video or audio. 
- If you are delivering to an external address, only drop into the mailbox and leave. 
- Make sure to mark down who takes an Eagle File, and who doesn't. 

We'll be meeting slightly early for briefing prior to serving files.
