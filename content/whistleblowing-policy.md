If you have any information and/or evidence that can help with our investigation, and wish to detail your experience on-the-record we can arrange one or more of the following things:

- A public payphone interview where you will go to a public payphone at a set time and wait for us to call it.
- An in-person interview where a NIMSU mule will meet on The NIMSU Team's behalf.
- While not recommended, we can also do email interviewing, however we delete our emails to protect whistleblower identities once we finish our investigations and secure the data on an encrypted drive.

We treat your submission as a genuine lead, and give it fair treatment during our investigation, no matter who you are or who you are representing. Impartiality is important to The NIMSU Team.

If you have feedback or suggestions on how we can improve our processes, you can contact us via the nimsu-tips ProtonMail.
